# f1-2021-dash

The dashboard is [here](https://f1-2021-dash-app.onrender.com/).

A simple dashboard to visualize statistics from the 2021 season of Formula 1 races. 

## Motivation and Purpose

The link to the proposal which contains the target audience for this project is [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/f1-2021-analysis/blob/main/reports/proposal.md)

## Usage

There are 3 main plots that the user can interact with. On the top, the user can choose from the dropdown menu the driver's name which will then display the driver's information, such as his team and country, in a table. A picture of the driver will also be displayed. On the bottom left, there is a dropdown menu, which the user can use to choose the ranking criteria for the drivers which will change the bar plot. The user can choose to rank drivers by the number of podiums, points, or world championships. Finally, on the bottom right there is another dropdown menu which allows the user to select a race in the season, and checkboxes to select drivers. This will display the drivers' laptime distribution for that race in a boxplot.
